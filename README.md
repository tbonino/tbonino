### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Thomas Bonino, and I am returning to school to major in Computer Science. I have played around on computers since I could walk, and am having lots of fun learning about what's going on under the hood!

### I am currently learning C++ and have already learned Python, SQL, Linux and lots of math. I am still looking for my "niche" in CS, but so far I am interested in Software Development and have had an instinct to work on the back end of things. I am always looking for more experience and learning opportunities!

### The intention of this Github page is to archive/refer to my past work, and hopefully be a gateway into learning much, much more of all there is to learn in the big wide world of Computer Science.
